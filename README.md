## Project structure
| File or folder | Description                    |
| -------------- | -----------                    |
| src/index.js   | the entry file                 |
| src/components | reusable React components      |
| src/parts      | single-use React components    |
| src/resume     | the main view of project       |

## Notes
Consider using Redux for larger applications to prevent from passing props through multiple levels of the component trees.
